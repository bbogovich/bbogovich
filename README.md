## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my public GitHub profile!

I've officially been working in software development for 25 years, which is slightly unnerving.  Where has the time gone?  It's been some time since I've been able to work on personal projects, but lately I'm feeling the need to upskill on several topics and plan to finally start using my account again for prototyping and demo work.

### Current Areas of Interest
- WebAssembly
- Web Components
- SDL
- MacOS development in Swift
- Augmented Reality GIS implementation

### Learning Topics
- C++ skill refresh
- Rust, Go fundamentals

Professionally, I'm a development expert at SAP, sometimes called "the very, very big comany in Germany".  I have a corporate GitHub profile, but no projects that can be shared at this time.  I'm a full stack developer and UX designer, recently primarily focused on web development for SAP's cloud offerings.  We're well aware of our historical reputation as having difficult to use user interfaces.  As our the main customer interfaces are migrated to the web have been working hard to simplify our tools and workflow with a focus on ease of use, performance, and general "quality of life" improvements to make our customers' jobs easier and more efficient.

Recently I've working on a series of technical blogs and video presentations for internal use.  The videos are likely to include puppets, becuase why not.  In the past I've found short puppet video skits at the start of a presentation to be a good "hook" to get an audience engaged.  As of now I'm considering a format that's something of a cross between the [JavaScript Visualized](https://www.youtube.com/@theavocoder) series and [The Why Files](https://www.youtube.com/@TheWhyFiles).  It would be a series of technical deep dives with a fair amount of animated diagrams, with a couple silly characters occasionally interrupting to break things up either by challenging a point or having confusion over a topic that can be discussed instead of simply presenting a list or definition.  For topics that don't cover proprietary material I may be posting these to YouTube and/or a public blog, but that's a subject for 2026.  Still being a bit uncomfortable on camera, I've been playing with Twitch streaming my Photoshop editing sessions to get more used to the idea.

My previous work has mostly revolved around web development in various forms, dating back to the "bad old days" of the Internet Exporer vs Netweaver wars.  It was a a simpler time on the internet, when men were men, women were men, and children were FBI agents.  I do occasionally miss the old IRC culture.

Outside of the coding world, my interests primarily revolve around the visual arts in various forms.  I'm a photographer, competitive filmmaker, absolute beginner in digital painting, and dabbler in any new medium that catches my interest.  Lately I've been working in Blender to design 3d relief carvings for my CNC.  I also write short fiction under a clever alias to confront the terrifying voices in the depths of my soul, but good luck tracking that down.

### Past professional projects:

- Web GIS applications based on ArcIMS, ArcGIS, and UMN Mapserver
- Internal software for small teleconferencing companies, including call center interfaces and live streaming platforms
- "Screen scraping" web interfaces for old IBM mainframe terminal applications
- Supply chain network visualization interfaces
- IT administration
- Corporate web design and site development
- Countless volumes of user and developer documentation

### Slillsets

I've done some things in the last quarter century.  Unfortunately much of what I've learned over time has become functionally obsolete, so quite a bit is no longer relevant and will be left off the list.

#### Coding
- JavaScript, CSS
- Abusing NodeJS for fun and profit
- SAP ABAP
- SAPUI5
- Swift
- Performance optimization
- Reusable component libraries

##### Outdated skills needing a refresher
- PHP
- Java
- C/C++

#### "Soft Skills"
- Database design
- Application architecture design
- Requirements definition
- Directing cross location teams
- UX Design
- "Mentorship" of junior developers
- Technical documentation
